    "# Week 3 Computer Exercise - Linear models and vegetation structure #\n",
    "***\n",
    "This week you will run R code to conduct some analyses of the tree measurement data you collected in Centennial Park. You will calculate some statistics and make some plots, and you will learn to define a linear model to describe the relationship between height and stem diameter at breast height (DBH). Then you will look at another dataset of tree measurements from the Ausplots Forests project, and compare that to the classes data. The exercise is a key component in three of the Course Learning Outcomes. It involves understanding experimental methods; processing, analysing, and interpreting data; and, communicating results in visual forms suitable for scientific reports.\n",
    "\n",

    "## Linear regression ##\n",
    "Linear regression is a very commonly used statistical technique among scientists who explore the natural world. It is used to model the relationship between a response (also called dependent) variable y and an explanatory (also called independent or predictor) variable x. For example, we could use linear regression to test whether temperature (the explanatory variable) is a good predictor of plant height (the response variable). We will use it to test how well DBH can predcit tree height.\n",
    "\n",
    "In linear regression the model takes the form $y = \\alpha + \\beta{x} + \\epsilon$\n",
    "* $\\alpha$ is the intercept (the value of y when x = 0)\n",
    "* $\\beta$ is the slope (amount of change in y for each unit of x\n",
    "* $\\epsilon$ is the error term.\n",
    "\n",
    "The error term is the part that makes the model statistical rather than mathematical. The error term is drawn from a statistical distribution that captures the random variability in the response, and is assumed to be a normal (Gaussian) distribution. The goal in linear regression is to obtain the best estimates for the model coefficients ($\\alpha$ and $\\beta$). You should be aware that sometimes the model is written with different symbols for the coefficients (e.g., y = mx + b), and sometimes it is called called Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) linear regression. This is because the model finds the best values for the coeficients as those that minimise the sum of the squared difference between measured and modelled values. We will explore this concept during the notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "## Why do a regression? ##\n",
    "Why would we want to predict tree height from DBH measurements?\n",
    "\n",
    "One reason to predict height from DBH, is so you dont need to measure height during field work. It is pretty easy to measure DBH, as you discovered. Tree height is much more difficult to get accurate. This is often the point of modelling: to predict a measurement that is difficult to measure from one (or several) that is (or are) much easier to measure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another reason is that a linear regression model summarises the shape of the data into a line, described by its intercept and slope. This makes it easier to look at differences between two different datasets. For example, we can see if the relationship between DBH and height is different for trees measured by the class and those from mature forest sites measured by Ausplots Forests.\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "## Part 1. The class data ##\n",
    "First we will load the ggplot2 library that we will use for plotting, then we will load up the tree measurment data from the CSV file. We can print out the column names to remind ourselves how the data is organised, and print out the number of rows, to see how many trees were measured."
