The following text cells explain several important conponents of the R language, while the code cells demonstrate each component with an example. The next cell is a code cell, with a single line of code. Click on the cell to highlight it, and then click on the run button to see what the code does. When code is running the cell has `[*]` next to it, and when it is finished it has a number `[1]`, which is the number of times it has been run."
