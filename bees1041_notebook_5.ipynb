        "This week you will use Python in this Jupyter notebook rather than R. The notebook shows that it is using `Python 3` in the top right corner. It sepcifies version `3` as there was a big change from version 2, and some people still like to use 'Python 2'. Python is very similar to R in many ways, as it is commonly used for scientific coding, it has lots of packages with specialist functions available, which are also refered to as libraries or modules. It also has some key differences to R, such as:\n",
        "- Python doesn't use the `<-` symbol, it just uses the equal sign `=`.\n",
        "- When counting, Python starts from 0 rather than 1.\n",
        "- Python doesn't let you import functions with the same name.\n",
        "- In Python you normally call a function from a module using the format `module.function()`.\n",
        "- It is a general-purpose programming language, while R has its roots in statistical analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "The notebook is split into two exercises. First you will be introduced to some basic python code, to see how it works. Secondly, we will use spatial data to make some global maps, to learn how you can code with spatial data as well as spreadsheet data, and to see how different projections change the shape of the globe. Some of the cells in the latter part of the notebook might take a couple of minutes to run, but just wait until the `[*]` finishes to see the output.\n",

You can easily create variables to store strings. For example, in the next code cell, you create a variable called `x` which stores the string `\"Hello world!\"`. You can then print the string in the output using the function `print()`."

        "Now that you have seen some Python code, you will use it to plot some spatial data. I could have shown you how to read data from CSV files, conduct statistical analyses, and make plots using Python, just like you've learned in R. Instead of showing how to do the same thing, I thought you could look at plotting spatial data, which is an area where Python is really good. For example, the [Digital Earth Australia Sandbox](https://www.dea.ga.gov.au/) uses Python in Jupyter Notebooks to allow users to access and analyse spatial data all over Australia, using a special Python module called `datacube`.\n",

This file is a raster dataset of global topography and bathymetry (elevation above and below sea level) that I downloaded from [GEBCO](https://www.gebco.net/data_and_products/gridded_bathymetry_data/). I processed the data to make it a smaller file size, and easier to work with. Raster data is stored as a grid, or image, where the grid cells (or image pixels) are just numbers arranged in rows and columns. This makes them perfect to be read as `numpy` arrays. In order to read the GEBCO data with python, we need to import the `gdal` module. [GDAL](https://gdal.org/) is a translator library for raster and vector geospatial data formats, and is used by QGIS and ArcGIS. The following code imports the `gdal` library, then opens the GEBCO data and reads it in as a `numpy array`."

Adding a colour scale bar is a little trickier, as it requires creating another axis and defining the maximum and minimum elevation values.

By experimenting with different projections, you have also seen how all global maps need to distort the round surface to a flat plane.
